The goal of `baf` is to provide lightweight block assignment (and equivalence) files from the US Census Bureau.

## Installation

You can install the development version of baf like so:

``` r
pak::pak('christopherkenny/baf')
```

## Example

The workhorse function for `baf` is the `baf()` function.

```{r}
library(baf)

baf(state = 'NM', year = 2024, geographies = 'cd')
```

## Cache

By default, `baf` loads files to a temporary directory.
To retain files across sessions, set the `cache_to` argument to a directory of your choosing.
You can also set `options(baf.use_cache = TRUE)` to create a user-level cache that can persist across projects.
